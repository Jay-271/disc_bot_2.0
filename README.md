# This repo was created to house newer disc bot

A lot of this code is specific to a specific private Discord channel I house. Therefore, some channel IDs and the such have been replaced with '0' or None

To run install dependencies needed and run Node.js. The only difference from old repo is updated OpenAI API usage.

## Major changes
- DALLE image generation using DALL-E
- Better functionality/error handling

## What doesn't work:

> Realtime_voice.js 

- I tried implementing this as it was releasing from the beta but to no avail. Got some boilerplate though!
